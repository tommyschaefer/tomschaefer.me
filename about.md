Hi, I'm Tom. ðŸ‘‹


I'm a developer and animal lover currently living in Denton, Texas. I live with
my girlfriend, two cats, two dogs, and bunny. I work remotely, as a Senior
Software Developer for [TEECOM](https://teecom.com)'s research and development
group, [TEECOMlabs](https://labs.teecom.com).

When it comes to programming, I like thinking about problems in different ways.
I've recently enjoyed learning more about functional programming. I'm primarily
a Rails devleoper, but I have a fair amount of experience in Go too. My current
hobby has been learning Haskell, and more recently Elixir.

I volunteer every week at a nearby animal rescue, [Texas Rustlers](#), where I
help tend to a bunch of guinnea pigs, rabbits, hamsters, and more! If you happen
to live in the DFW area and are looking for a furry friend, get in touch!
